## Notice from the Tournament Organizer

Team Lux has won the final match versus Team puborkia, but upon reviewing the replays, Team Lux was found to be using Ultimate Pills and Ultimate Vials in both matches, which is a direct violation of the Tournament Rules.

Both teams were given the opportunity to do a rematch, but Team puborkia, the team that completed the matches fairly, did not have time for a rematch. Per the rules of the tournament, the team that cheated (Lux) has therefore lost their win and thus Team puborkia has been declared the winner of this tournament.
